## Working with Remotes

The extension fully supports [Remote Development](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) scenarios. 

It means that when you connect to a _remote_ location, like a Docker Container, SSH or WSL, the extension will be available, ready to be used. 

> You don't need to install the extension on the remote.

Better yet, if you use `bookmarks.saveBookmarksInProject` setting defined as `true`, the bookmarks saved locally _will be available_ remotely, and you will be able to navigate and update the bookmarks. Just like it was a resource from folder you opened remotely.
