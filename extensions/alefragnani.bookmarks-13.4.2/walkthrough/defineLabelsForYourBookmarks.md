## Define Labels for Your Bookmarks

Bookmarks represent positions in your code, so you can easily and quickly go back to them whenever necessary. But sometimes its position or the content of that line is not so meaningful as you would like to be. 

To fill this gap, you can define **Labels** to be tied to the bookmark. 

You can eaily type your own **Label** when you toggle a bookmark, or you can ask the extension to suggest for you.

You have a handlfull of alternatives to choose:

  * `useWhenSelected`: Use the selected text _(if available)_ directly, no confirmation required
  * `suggestWhenSelected`: Suggests the selected text _(if available)_. You still need to confirm.
  * `suggestWhenSelectedOrLineWhenNoSelected`: Suggests the selected text _(if available)_ or the entire line (when has no selection). You still need to confirm
