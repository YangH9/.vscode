## Introduction

This [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension adds support for
effectively editing, refactoring, running, and reloading [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
mobile apps. It depends on (and will automatically install) the
[Dart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code)
for support for the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language.

Note: Projects should be run using `F5` or the `Debug` menu for full debugging functionality. Running from the built-in terminal will not provide all features.

## Installation

[Install from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) or by [searching within VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_search-for-an-extension). The Dart extension will be installed automatically, if not already installed.

## Documentation

Please see the [Flutter documentation for using VS Code](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/vs-code).

## Reporting Issues

Issues for both Dart and Flutter extensions should be reported in the [Dart-Code issue tracker](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code/issues).
